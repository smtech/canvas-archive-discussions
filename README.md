# Archive Discussions

A tool to generate a JSON export of a course or group's discussions. Particularly useful for account-level groups that lack any meaningful copy/archive capabilities out of the box. Currently, this tool is works fine... so long as you have fewer than 50 discussions, each with fewer than 50 topic entries (because I haven't bothered to deal with the pagination in the Canvas API's responses -- I didn't need to for the one thing that I needed to back up).

## Known Issues

The issues tracking hasn't yet been pulled over to this repo and still lives in [our original Canvas repo](http://github.com/smtech/canvas/issues?milestone=5).
